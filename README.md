# Semesterplanner

This package encapsules several useful environments for a beautiful printable semester plan. 
It includes a timetable (which is using the schedule-Package) as well as appointments, deadlines and exams.

This package requires color, tikz, schedule and fontawesome. Furthermore documents need to be compiled with LuaLaTeX.
